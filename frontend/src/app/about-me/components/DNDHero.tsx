                <p>DND is one of my more recent enjoyments, as I only started getting into it about 4 years ago. I enjoy it because it's a cooperative story. I enjoy being the one who creates the outline of the story because it gives me a chance to see what people would do in different situations. I also enjoy playing, and have played multiple one-shots as different characters. It provides a lot of variety in character choice, and it is an outlet of creation for me and my group. Creating characters, stories, and worlds is a very fun past-time, and plus, hearing the dice click together when rolling them is a euphoric experience.</p>
