        <p class="m-5 px-4 flex">Hello! My name is Joshua Yu. I was born in Albuquerque in 2001, and grew up in the Northeast Heights area. I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high-school, and I attended Rio Grande Enrichment Studies as a part of my high-school experience. During high-school, I worked as an independent "landscaper" for friends and family, mostly consisting of basic yard work/cleanup. I also attended CNM as a dual credit student, and got about halfway through to an associates degree in communications. After graduating high-school, I worked at Dion's for 4 years, working my way up to becoming the Assistant Catering Manager.<br>Growing up in New Mexico, I gained an appreciation for the natural beauty of the dessert, and I enjoy taking walks and hikes out in it. It gives me a certain sense of peace. I have a few other interests in life, like Rubik's Cubes, reading, taking long drives, and others. Some will be detailed out below!</p>
