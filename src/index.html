            <p class="p-4">Hello! My name is Joshua Yu. I was born in Albuquerque in 2001, and grew up in the Northeast Heights area. I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high-school, and I attended Rio Grande Enrichment Studies as a part of my high-school experience. During high-school, I worked as an independent "landscaper" for friends and family, mostly consisting of basic yard work/cleanup. I also attended CNM as a dual credit student, and got about halfway through to an associates degree in communications. After graduating high-school, I worked at Dion's for 4 years, working my way up to becoming the Assistant Catering Manager.<br>I have many interests, but the ones I want to tell you about are my love for music, DND, and anime. My love for music started when I first learned the piano and violin at a young age. My love for DND started about 4 years ago, as it became a new way I could spend time with friends on a cooperative project. And my love for anime has been around since i was 5, and it has grown in the last few years as I have watched more and more.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-center">DND</h2>
        <p>DND is one of my more recent enjoyments, as I only started getting into it about 4 years ago. I enjoy it because it's a cooperative story. I enjoy being the one who creates the outline of the story because it gives me a chance to see what people would do in different situations. I also enjoy playing, and have played multiple one-shots as different characters. It provides a lot of variety in character choice, and it is an outlet of creation for me and my group. Creating characters, stories, and worlds is a very fun past-time, and plus, hearing the dice click together when rolling them is a very euphoric sound.</p>
