  <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My site will be one page, with an opaque background image of New Mexico landscape that I have, with the following sections as detailed below. It will have a nav bar at the top that will provide "links" to the different sections, and will be sticky, so it can scroll with the user. The following sections are:</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This section will feature a brief introduction and bio giving some information about who I am. It will be displayed in a container box next to an image of me. The rest of the page will be broken into four different sections, each one detailing one of my personal interests.</p>
    <p><b>Music:</b> This will give a brief overview of my love for music, detailing the instruments I can play and embed the links to some of my Spotify playlists. I will put all these in a contained grid, with the colors matching the ones from my Spotify playlists.</p>
    <p><b>DND:</b> This will give a brief overview of one of my cooperative enjoyments; DND. It will be a container with a full background spanning the width of the page, and will just give some details on why I enjoy it.</p>
    <p><b>Anime:</b> This will be a flex box with text surrounded by evenly spaced image of my favorite anime's. It will provide links to the wikipedia, IMDb, or other source article on each anime. The titles will be in an enclosed grid</p>
    <p><b>Nintendo Games:</b> This section will be a responsive photo gallery. I will include photos of my games of choice, and if you hover over the photo, a pop-up text box will come up with some details of the game. The photos featured will be from actual gameplay taken off of my Nintendo Switch.</p>
    <p><b>Contact:</b> The very bottom section of the page will be a contact form, allowing the user to get in touch with me either via email or LinkedIn, and will provide links to my GitHub and LinkedIn, which will also be linked in the footer via icons.</p>
  <h1>Wireframes</h1>
    <p>This site will be fully responsive on mobile and desktop, and the wireframes were created on <a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/"></a>.</p>
