    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This section will feature a brief introduction and bio giving some information about who I am. It will be displayed in a container box next to an image of me. The rest of the page will be broken into four different sections, each one detailing one of my personal interests.</p>
    <p> <b>Music:</b> This will give a brief overview of my love for music, detailing the instruments I can play and embed the links to some of my Spotify playlists. I will put all these in a contained grid, with the colors matching the ones from my Spotify playlists.</p>
    <p> <b>DND:</b> This will give a brief overview of one of my cooperative enjoyments; DND. It will be a container with a full background spanning the width of the page, and will just give some detials on why I enjoy it.</p>
