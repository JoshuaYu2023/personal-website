  <h1>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>My purpose for my PWP is to showcase what all I have learned in the DDC Bootcamp via an "About Me" website style. I will give a brief bio, and then show off some of my personal interests. The personal interests I will be showcasing are my love for music, DND, Anime, and Nintendo games. I will create different section for each interest, each section keeping to the same CSS layout, slightly changing the theme to better match the interest vibe.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p> The audience I want to reach will be future employers and new coders; either in future cohorts or people trying to learn on their own. For future employers, I will use this page in my portfolio as a way to showcase my different skills as I graduate form DDC Bootcamp. For new coders, I will use resources such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram to get my name out there, (this will also be for personal marketing, so I can get a job), and promote my services as a freelance mentor.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal with this PWP will be to acquire a full-time job or internship with a development company. As stated earlier in my "Purpose", I want to use this PWP as a showcase for my skills, while also giving a more surface level "About Me". It will be a fun way to prove what I can do, while giving a brief introduction of myself as a person.</p>

  <h1>Persona</h1>
    <h2>Name</h2>
      <p>Alfred P. Hendrick</p>

    <h2>Age</h2>
      <p>45</p>

    <h2>Profession</h2>
      <p>Alfred works as an HR Supervisor for BigTech Inc. They are looking to hire on new junior developers as they have had a lot of internal turnover, promotions, and retirees. They are looking to find someone with the hard skills necessary to make quality websites quickly and efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>Windows power user. Uses a Lenovo Yoga connected to 2 24" ACER monitors while in the office, a DELL Inspiron laptop while at home, both running Windows 11, and uses Chrome as his browser on both. He uses an iPhone 13 with an unlimited 5G data plan, and Chrome as his phone browser as well.</p>

    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
      <p>Alfred feels like there's not enough time in the work day, but wants to keep a good work/life balance with his family. Alfred not only is in charge of the hiring process, but has various other HR roles to fulfill, so he only spends about 5 minutes looking over portfolios of potential employees after the initial interview process. He communicates with networking managers around town to find good future employees as well.</p>

    <h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
      <p>Alfred is looking for new junior developers who are just joining the web developer world, as he has to fill about 8 empty positions in 1 week. He needs to make sure that the candidate will fit the personality of the BigTech Inc. team, as well as the employee culture that has formed over the years. He has plenty of candidates to weed through as the position can be fulfilled by remote employees, and has contacts with networking managers across the country. As stated before, he has 1 week to fill 8 positions with junior developers, so he needs to find candidates who have the skill set needed to be put on projects right away with minimal to no training.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Alfred is looking for two things in each candidate: the necessary skills and the personality that can easily mesh with the BigTech Inc. team. He needs to know within 5 minutes if the candidates he's reviewing have what he needs in order to get a callback form him. He needs to finish these reviews quickly so that the hiring process can proceed ASAP.</p>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
      <p>"As a user, I need to quickly ascertain the skill level of the candidate, and their personality in order to determine if I should give them a callback."</p>
