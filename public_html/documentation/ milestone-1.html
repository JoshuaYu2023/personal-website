  <h1>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>My purpose for my PWP is to showcase what all I have learned in the DDC Bootcamp via an "About Me" website style. I will give a brief bio, and then  show off some of my personal interests. The personal interests I will be showcasing are my love for music, DND, Anime, and Nintendo games. I will create different pages for each interest, each page keeping to the same CSS layout, slightly changing the theme to better match the interest vibe.</p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p> The audience I want to reach will be future employers and new coders; either in future cohorts or people trying to learn on their own. For future employers, I will use this page in my portfolio as a way to showcase my different skills as I graduate form DDC Bootcamp. For new coders, I will use resources such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram to get my name out there, (this will also be for personal marketing, so I can get a job), and promote my services as a freelance mentor.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal with this PWP will be to acquire a full-time job or internship with a development company. As stated earlier in my "Purpose", I want to use this PWP as a showcase for my skills, while also giving a more surface level "About Me". It will be a fun way to prove what I can do, while giving a brief introduction of myself as a person. </p>
